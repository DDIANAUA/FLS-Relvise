Relvise is a practice website I created as part of my HTML and CSS learning journey.
The project was made by following a tutorial from the YouTube channel Фрілансер по життю (“Freelancer for life”).

This project helped me better understand HTML structure, component-based layout, and the basics of CSS styling.

During development, I used:
semantic HTML markup;
CSS for styling;
Flexbox for layout building.

This website is not a commercial or finished product — it's a learning project that helped me gain hands-on experience in web development.
